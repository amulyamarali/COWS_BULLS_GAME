# COWS_BULLS_GAME
I created a Cows and Bulls game using Python and also adapted voice assistance by using text to speech conversion.
Here, you can a play a game where you have 10 attempts to guess the right four digit code.
RULES:
The four digit code has unique numbers from 0 to 9. Which means the numbers are not repeated
The player has 10 attempts.
The code entered by the player should not have any spaces between them.
Cows denote the no of right digits.
Bulls denote the no od right places.

I have just tried to implement the Mastermind game in my own way.
You can use my code and enhance by adding more features such as GUI.
Thank you for looking into it.
